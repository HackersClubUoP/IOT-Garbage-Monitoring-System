# IOT-Garbage-Monitoring-System
This solution is a very innovative system which helps to make the garbage collecting process in an efficient way .Here we make a small device which is fixed on the top of the bin lid which is powered by using removable battery.It includes an ultrasonic sensor.It detects the real time garbage level and wirelessly transmit both fill level and battery level of each bin to the server.That data is also stored in the database.Using that data, visualize the garbage level and battery level of each bin and shortest path to collect the garbage in the web interface.Instead of blindly collecting waste using statics routes we choose routes for garbage collectors based on where the collection is actually needed.
